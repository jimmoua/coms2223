### Four modules in a computer
1. Primrary Memory
  + Holds data being manipulated
2. CPU
  + Performs manipulation
  + Repeatedly and continually performs **Fetch-Decode-Execute** cycle.
3.  Peripherals
  + I/O Devices
4. Bus 
  + joins the other modules together

### Combinational Circuits
+ Output-pure function of inputs
  + Define these functions in these circuits via a **truth table**.
    + Simplify with a K-map.
+ Can be built without loops.

### Sequential Circuits
+ Output depends on entire sequence of inputs; summarised into a finite state.
+ Has loops
  + i.e $\bar{\text{S}}$-$\bar{\text{R}}$ Latch

### 4 Kinds of Machine Language Instructions
+ Data Movement
  + General purpose registers. These are faster than main memory and are
    shorter to refer to them.
+ Arithmetic & Logical
+ Control Sequencing
+ Machine Hood
  + affects machine-hood nature of system
  + a halt instruction $\longrightarrow$ stops fetch-decode-execute
